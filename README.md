# Extent of Income on Happiness: Poster Presentation
This repository contains a poster presentation for my research on the extent to which income influences happiness, it has been created with the R package posterdown using the R Markdown file Dollardilemma.Rmd. The research investigates the relationship between income and happiness using the World Happiness Report dataset. The analysis suggests that income has a positive impact on happiness up to a certain point, beyond which the effect starts to diminish. This finding highlights the importance of policies that aim to ensure a minimum level of income for individuals to achieve basic needs and improve their well-being.
